Their coffee is great, but once you have experienced a Monday night at Austin’s it's the culture that will keep you coming, back because with a taste of it you quench a thirst you might not have known you had. Every week is different, and obviously well worth it given the fact that parking is always such a pain in the ass.</p><p>Orlando Malice has embraced Austin’s open mic night as one of the first cultural platforms it religiously attends. Come Monday night Bamboo, CyC or Nova can be spotted floating around vibing & networking ready to embrace any new face and encouraging an environment for talent to grow. Networking is key in this life of who you know, and things like this bring the right people together. Nothing is forced here, the coffee shop is small enough for one person to manage which gives it an at home feel. This level of comfort makes the lack of personal space an upside, talking and interacting with one another is the norm. One can only imagine how powerful the same energy would be if it were a dedicated venue. However, if it were any larger it might attract just enough attention to change how intimate it feels. Everywhere you look you'll catch cyphers going on: on the front patio, out back, and anywhere in the parking lot. So much energy that even after the stage is empty, the equipment is packed away, and the host and DJ have gone home, you can still find the boys that came to spit in huddles rhyming. They'll go a cappella or to a beat someone makes by banging on a bucket. This is a kind of energy OM gravitates toward.</p><p><b></b></p><p>For many of the local rappers, Austin’s open mic night is their first opportunity to get on a stage and perform their art for a live audience.  These aren't artists with huge followings, radio play, or even real underground recognition. In fact, Most of them have simple day jobs at places like Publix or Best Buy and this is their little slice of freedom. Watching an artist get a taste of energy from the stage inspires everyone present to work at their craft. Some of the best energy comes from a newcomer who wastes no time establishing themselves and adapting to this kind of free expression with little filter or anticipation of judgement. This outlet for local emcees does not  go to waste, week after week regulars and newcomers alike come out and spill their heart and soul into that microphone. </p><p>Every week I show up and hope the chairs in the front are available. These are usually the abandoned seats condemning the poor fool straddling them to really listening to these artists. Some nights every performance is powerful and sitting up front is a blessing.  Sitting this close not only means your feet rest on the stage but from this proximity your energy is now a part of the performance. If your eyes are wandering or you aren't interacting with the artist they may get distracted and lose focus. If the front row seems attentive and interested you can see the passion within the artist ignite. I make a personal effort to always be right in the front, taking notes, even bobbing my head when the message really strikes me.</p><p>Every Monday I watch local emcees sharpen their performance//freestyle ability and gain more confidence behind the mic. It makes me question if open mic Hip-Hop nights all over the country are as true to the essence of expression as Monday nights here. I also question how many emcees are as talented as the Warriors that come out of the Orlando scene.</p><p>There are three rules for stepping up to the mic at Austin’s on Monday:</p><ol><li>If you don't love hip-hop we have two words for you, "The Exit". One in the front one in the back.</li><li>This is a judgement free zone, you get a pass to say whatever your dirty little mind wants.</li><li>If you don't like the beat there is no asking to change it up, pass the mic and let another emcee do his thing.</li></ol><p><b></b></p><p>Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the host makes his way onstage for the opening ceremony, he begins by sharing the rules with the crowd as well as any newcomers before handing the mic to the first person waiting in line. A line which begins at the side of the stage and works its way through the front door and out to the front patio.  The overall vibe is very welcoming and accepting, any artist that steps on stage is given the creative freedom to perform either a freestyle or written verse.  If you have the confidence in your persona on stage and you play it well, people genuinely listen and even nod their heads to show they are feeling the flow. When the crowd claps as someone steps away from the mic there is a level of sincerity to the applause, it's not just to show respect.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Performing every Monday for a crowd is a powerful tool for these aspiring artists because like they say, practice makes perfect. There is a noticeable level of comfort that the regulars begin to develop that feels like they could take their performance anywhere. The seasoned lyricists often meld written bars with freestyle, turning verses from different songs into one long fresh verse. When executed correctly it's difficult to tell if an artist is going off the top or practicing a verse. I know some of these guys personally so on occasion I recognize bits and  pieces of their delivery, yet I am still impressed with how effortlessly they can switch between written and fresh material. </p><p><b></b></p><p>Some nights are so gratifying I almost feel guilty it was free, I'm sure if it were any other venue I would be paying decent money for so many inspiring performances. I know this because some of the artist who really make the experience worth it are genuinely living this lifestyle, making their living off paid shows and independent album sales. A lot of respectable names in Orlando Hip-Hop drop by so often that if you just started going in January of 2016 you'll have seen Johnny Storm, Mehsi, MyVerse, Too Major, E-turn, Swamburger, J-Terra and a handful of other established rappers as well as up-and-coming names. When one of these artists gets on stage and rips it for 6 minutes no one is worried about when their time is up or when he's going to pass the mic, We all hope they just continue to bless the stage. These performances don't look like practice, they're executed with precision for the love of the culture and the city beautiful. </p><p><b></b></p><p>There are artist on my radar today I would have never heard of if it wasn't for Hip-Hop Mondays at Austin's, Orlando talent that deserves recognition from the city. Recognizing how much talent touches the mic at this event really gave me a sense of pride and appreciation for my city and those in it. I don't think the rest of the world realizes just how much Orlando has going on, and it's our job to get it out there. I'm not just speaking on music either, Central Florida is home to many talented creatives of different mediums. Our laws on street art & performances may not fully reflect that, but who's laws really reflect the opinion of the average man? This is the year that we take some big steps in the right direction toward letting the rest of the world know that Orlando is home to a lot more than Disney. Florida in general is a special place in the south, for better or for worse we don't have the stereotypical southern culture. We have more of a north and south mix here, lots of really southern citizens and just as many New Yorkers looking for some sun, with everything in between. Orlando is a melting pot of creative cultures and it's time for us to embrace that. Time to recognize that we aren't lacking an identity because of the mix, the mix IS our identity.</p><picture>
